* [Yassine Jerroudi](https://x.com/Jerroudi_Yass) : Helped significantly with the early version of the rootkit client GUI, since I was a complete noob with IMGUI. Deserves all the credit.
* [IDontCode](https://x.com/_xeroxz) [BackEngineerLab](https://x.com/BackEngineerLab): All credit for the implementation of swapping the driver on disk and in memory.
* sixtyvividtails : Thanks to him for recommending probing ObjectAttributes->ObjectName->Buffer at all three levels, since we are hooking NtCreateFile and receive user-controlled pointers.
* [Pavel Yosifovich](https://x.com/zodiacon) : the author of Windows Kernel Programming, this book remains the single most valuable resource I rely on, without a solid understanding of kernel internals, you can’t just vibe-code drivers. real knowledge is the only thing that keeps you from getting completely cooked <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fafe8039-9d47-4d6c-87e9-c11a5fcdc130"
