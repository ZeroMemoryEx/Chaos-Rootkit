* Yassine Jerroudi: helped significantly with the rootkit-client GUI version, deserves all the credits.
  
* [IDontCode](https://x.com/_xeroxz) [BackEngineerLab](https://x.com/BackEngineerLab): All credit for the implementation of swapping the driver on disk and in memory.
  
* [sixtyvividtails](https://x.com/sixtyvividtails/status/1990792400378478610) : for highlighting that try/except cannot safely guard against invalid user-mode pointers in kernel space, and that proper probing (ProbeForRead/ProbeForWrite) is required to avoid BSOD-level faults.

* [Pavel Yosifovich](https://x.com/zodiacon) :  the author of Windows Kernel Programming, this book remains the single most valuable resource I rely on, without a solid understanding of kernel internals, you can’t just "vibe-code" drivers. real knowledge is the only thing that keeps you from getting completely cooked <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fafe8039-9d47-4d6c-87e9-c11a5fcdc130"
